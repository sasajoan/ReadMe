## Why SE? 

I will never forget my first steps of coding path in college. I was under an extreme impress that I am the creator in this 
process, even though all the classmates were working on the same project. Whenever I had a chance to use my math skills I was 
in heaven and no bug could discourage me from finding a way to the solution. Solving puzzles made me feel that I am enhancing 
my critical thinking and complex problems solving skills by using logic and identifying complex problems; actively learning on
my own to understand the implication of the new information; and developing judgment and decision making skills by thoughtfully 
considering my options and actions to choose the most appropriate one. 

## What are the reasons behind SE?

I see software engineering carriers anchored in real-world problems. From my school experience, I believe that software 
engineers apply professional judgment acquired through practical experience and their training: project focused and 
team-centered. Software engineering is not a typical 9 to 5 job, it is a stressful environment and thus we have to enjoy what 
we are doing. I cope very well with stress and I will not let it demotivate me and negatively reflect on my work. We all realize 
that the job diversity is extending along with the new technology: working with real-time devices, mobile devices, web sites and 
web applications, server side development, database code and many more. There are plenty of functions and places for us, who 
like to code, where we will find our best one.
